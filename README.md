Remote to Zip
=============

This is meant to be a goofy little script that will allow you to come up with a tuple of file names and urls
and then add those to a local zip file and save it.

Usage:
- Download the file
- Update the values in there to whatever you want
- Type this

$ python remote_to_zip.py

- Whatever your zip file name is you passed it, unzip that

$ unzip john.zip

- Done.

Why:
I had a need for it in a project and that was that.  I wanted to share it around so I just grabbed the key parts and
put them here.  For whatever reason I had a hard time figuring out how to grab a remote file easily and put the contents
into a local file.
