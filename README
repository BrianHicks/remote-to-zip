Remote to Zip

This is meant to be a goofy little script that will allow you to come up with a tuple of file names and urls
and then add those to a local zip file and save it.

I had a need for it in a project and that was that.  I wanted to share it around so I just grabbed the key parts and
put them here.  For whatever reason I had a hard time figuring out how to grab a remote file easily and put the contents
into a local file.
